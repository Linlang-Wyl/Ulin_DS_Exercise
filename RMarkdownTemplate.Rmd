## R Markdown

Create lists with a dash:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages()
library()

summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
plot(pressure)
```
